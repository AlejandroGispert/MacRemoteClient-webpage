					<h2>1. Overview</h2>
					<p>
						Mac Remote Controller is a utility application that allows users to control their Mac computer using an Android device. The app operates over a local Wi-Fi network and requires the companion software "Mac Remote Controller Desktop" installed on the user's Mac computer.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mac Remote Controller ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, Mac companion application, and website.
					</p>

					<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>

						<li><strong>No user data is stored or shared</strong> - All functionality operates within your local environment</li>
						<li><strong>No personal information is collected</strong> - We do not access your contacts, photos, files, or any other personal data</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>2.1 Email Collection for Download Verification</h3>

					<h3>2.2 Website Analytics</h3>
					<p>
						Our website uses analytics services to understand how visitors interact with our website. These services collect anonymous usage statistics only after you grant consent via our cookie consent banner.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Necessary Analytics (Umami):</strong> We use Umami, a privacy-focused analytics service that collects minimal, anonymized data. Umami does not use cookies and respects Do Not Track headers. The data collected includes:
